This MS Excel dashboard is explaining road accidents in the United Kingdom for the years 2021-2023. 
Accidents are caused due to many reason but over here we have covered reasons like light conditions, road surfaces, road type.
I have covered 6 vehicle type which caused these accidents and gave insights on fatal casualities, serious casualities and slight casualities.
SO the metrics focused here is how many accidents happend in which year and compare it with the previous year .Which vehicle had the most accidents on which road surface, road type and light condition.I also included location as in was it rural or urban area.
